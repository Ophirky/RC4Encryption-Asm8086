### RC4 Encryption and Ransomeware ###
    This is my 10th grade final assembly project.
    This project contains 3 files:
        1. RC4.asm - The encryption procedures
        2. Ransomeware.asm - the virus code
        3. MainProgram.asm - the file that handles the user inputs

    # Yellow  -  Returning value
