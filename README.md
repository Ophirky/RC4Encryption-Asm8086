### RC4 Encryption and Ransomeware ###
    This is my 10th grade final assembly project.
    This project contains 3 files:
        1. rc4.asm - The encryption procedures
        2. scanner.asm - the file that scans a given folder and any subfolders
        3. mainProgram.asm - the file that handles the user inputs
